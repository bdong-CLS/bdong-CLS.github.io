Beidi Dong, a professor at George Mason University's department of criminology, law and society, explained that the pandemic imposed burdens on law enforcement. Many departments saw staffing shortages and officers and social service workers were limited in their ability to have face-to-face interactions with citizens that can help prevent crime.

"This is hard to predict," Dong noted. "Yet, if the more structural or root causes are not addressed, we MIGHT see a continued rise in violence despite changes in the pandemic picture."
