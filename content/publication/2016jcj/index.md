title: Escape from Violence--What Reduces the Enduring Consequences of Adolescent Gang Affiliation?


summary: The current study examineswhether perceived social support during emerging adulthood moderates the relationship between adolescent gang affiliation trajectories and violence in adulthood.


abstract: __Introduction__ <br> Adolescent gang affiliation has long-term, cascading effects across the life course, ruining life chances in multiple domains and leading to sustained involvement in crime and violence. Yet, limited empirical attention has been devoted to exploringwhat factors may buffer the risk of adolescent gang affiliation on violent behavior in adulthood. The current study examineswhether perceived social support during emerging adulthood moderates the relationship between adolescent gang affiliation trajectories and violence in adulthood. <br> __Methods__ <br> Using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study, we estimated developmental trajectories of adolescent gang affiliation. These trajectory groupswere then linked to later violence through Poisson regression models, establishing the relationship between adolescent gang affiliation, protective factors during emerging adulthood, and violence in established adulthood. <br> __Results__ <br> Having a committed partner relatively early in life protects individuals in the early-adolescence gang affiliation trajectory fromsustained violence, and perception of consistent support froma parent figure protects individuals in the late-adolescence gang affiliation trajectory from violence in adulthood. <br> __Conclusions__ <br> Perception of social support from a partner or parent figure can be critical in reducing the enduring consequences of gang affiliation. It is also important to recognize developmental heterogeneity among gang youths when intervening and providing support.
