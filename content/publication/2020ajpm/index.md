title: Poor Health and Violent Crime Hot Spots--Mitigating the Undesirable Co-Occurrence through Focused Place-Based Interventions

summary: To understand whether and how place-based interventions targeting micro-geographic places can reduce this undesirable co-occurrence, the study addresses two important questions.

abstract: __Introduction__ <br> The geographic overlap of violence and poor health is a major public health concern. To understand whether and how place-based interventions targeting micro-geographic places can reduce this undesirable co-occurrence, the study addresses 2 important questions. First, to what extent are deteriorated health conditions associated with living at violent crime hot spots? Second, through what mechanisms can focused place-based interventions break the association between living with violence and deteriorated health? <br> __Methods__ <br> This study used survey data from 2,724 respondents living on 328 street segments that were categorized as violent crime hot spots (181 segments with 1,532 respondents) versus non−hot spots (147 segments with 1,192 respondents) in 2013−2014 in Baltimore, Maryland. Propensity score analysis assessed whether individuals living at violent crime hot spots had lower general health perceptions than people living at non−hot spots. Marginal structural models estimated the proportion of total effects mediated by 3 theoretically informed intervening mechanisms. Analyses were conducted in 2019. <br> __Results__ <br> Respondents living at violent crime hot spots had a lower level of self-rated general health and higher levels of health limitations and problems than those living at non−hot spots. Enhanced perceptions of safety, collective efficacy, and police legitimacy may break the association between living in places with extremely high levels of violence and deteriorated health. <br> __Conclusions__ <br> Indicated or selective strategies are urgently needed to target micro-geographic locations with known increased risks, supplementing universal strategies applied to a broader community.
