title: Changes in Shooting Incidence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Between March and November 2020


summary: This study evaluated independent associations between COVID-19 containment policies and the killing of George Floyd on firearm violence in 1 US city, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


abstract: Firearm violence occurred more frequently in US cities in 2020 compared with previous years. Two major events of 2020 may explain this increase-- enactment of containment policies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and a national reckoning with systemic racism, including widespread protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. This study evaluated independent associations between COVID-19 containment policies and the killing of George Floyd on firearm violence in 1 US city, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
